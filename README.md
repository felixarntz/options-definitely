Options Definitely
==================

This framework plugin makes adding options to the WordPress admin area very simple, yet flexible. It all works using a single action and an array.

You can download the latest version from the [WordPress plugin repository](http://wordpress.org/plugins/options-definitely/). If you prefer to install it from Github, make sure to run `composer install` before using it in order to download the necessary dependencies.

For a detailed guide and reference on how to use this framework, please read the [Wiki on Github](https://github.com/felixarntz/options-definitely/wiki). Once you get familiar with the options you have, you will be able to create complex options interfaces in just a few minutes.

You can also contribute to the plugin by translating it. Simply visit [translate.wordpress.org](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/options-definitely) to get started. Note that you can help not only translating the plugin, but also the underlying library [_WPDLib_](https://github.com/felixarntz/wpdlib).
