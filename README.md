Options, Definitely
===================

This framework plugin makes adding options to the WordPress admin area very simple, yet flexible. It all works using a filter and an array.

You can download the latest version from the [WordPress plugin repository](http://wordpress.org/plugins/options-definitely/).

For a detailed guide and reference on how to use this framework, please read the [Wiki on Github](https://github.com/felixarntz/options-definitely/wiki). Once you get familiar with the options you have, you will be able to create complex options interfaces in just a few minutes.

Contributions and Bugs

If you have ideas on how to improve the plugin or if you discover a bug, I would appreciate if you shared them with me, right here on Github. In either case, please open a new issue [here](https://github.com/felixarntz/options-definitely/issues/new)!
